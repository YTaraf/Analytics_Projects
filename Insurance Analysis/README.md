# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project analyzes the relationship between personal attributes and health insurance costs using a publicly available dataset of 1,339 records. The dataset includes key variables such as:

- **Age**  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**  
- **Smoking Habits**  
- **Number of Dependents**  
- **Geographic Region**  

Our objective is to identify significant trends and actionable insights to inform both insurers and policyholders.

## Project Goals
1. **Understand Key Cost Drivers:**  
   Analyze factors like smoking status, BMI, age, and family size to uncover their impact on medical charges.
   
2. **Leverage Data Science Techniques:**  
   Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and data visualization to interpret the data and predict costs.

3. **Promote Awareness:**  
   Highlight behaviors or conditions linked to higher medical expenses and advocate for data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

## Key Features
- **Correlation Analysis:** Measure the relationships between attributes (e.g., BMI, smoking) and insurance costs.  
- **Regression Modeling:** Build predictive models to quantify the effect of each variable on medical charges.  
- **Data Visualizations:** Provide clear, actionable insights through informative charts and graphs.

## Results
The analysis reveals key drivers of insurance costs, emphasizing the impact of lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking) and physical health (e.g., BMI). These findings can help raise awareness about factors contributing to higher healthcare expenses and promote equitable solutions for insurers and policyholders.
