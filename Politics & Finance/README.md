## Project Details and Plan of Action 

The presidential election has always been a monumental moment in time and whichever candidate comes out victorious will shape the future of America for the years to come. While it is commonly known that each presidential candidate’s success will impact global and domestic policies, they will also play a crucial role on the economy of America. Minutes after a candidate is declared victorious the Stock Market begins to shift in favor of the candidate and what policies they have planned. In this project I will be examining the predictions relating to various stocks and their prices after the presidential election. I will be looking at the predictions made by articles published by two creditable news sources “ig” and “Yahoo Finance”. The project will be broken into various parts and all the code will be done with Python using various packages. 

## Part 1

The first part of the project will involve web scraping and will focus on the gathering of information. This part of the project will be focused on scraping information from articles from each company in relation to the presidential election and how each candidate will impact the market. The packages to be used in this part will be Beautiful soup, Json, Request, and so on. After parsing the data, I will use the obtained information to conduct the second part of this project.

## Part 2

The second part of this project will involve extracting the market share data of the stocks obtained from the web scraping portion. I will use the Polygon API to gather information about the closing price of each stock in a time series manner. This portion will track results from prior to the results of the election to the current last reported closing amount of each stock. This portion will heavily focus on principles of Object-Orientated-Programming to create classes and functions that will fetch the necessary information. 

## Part 3

The final portion of this project will focus on interactive visualizations that integrates all the information obtained from web scraping and API scraping. This portion will feature various charts and graphs to model the changes in stock prices over time and evaluate the accuracy of predictions made. Additionally, it will provide users with an intuitive way to explore trends, correlations, and insights derived from the data, making the analysis both accessible and actionable.
